# Wikify
Wikify is a web application that uses the Spotify Web APIPlayer and the Echo Nest to help you find music, videos and biographies of your favourite artists. You can check it out at [juaoregon.github.io](http://juaoregon.github.io/).

## Tools & languages
It is developed with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and uses external libraries like [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [Fancybox](http://fancybox.net/home). It also uses external APIs like [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and the [Echo Nest API](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4).

## TODO List

* Biography text design.
* ~~Similar Artists Button (it will display a _fancybox_ with artists that are similar to ours).~~
* ~~Artist Video Button (it will display a _fancybox_ with a playlist of all the artist's videos available).~~
* Refine album searching methods and filters.
* ~~Loading mask/unmask for templates.~~
* ~~Scroll-to-top button.~~
